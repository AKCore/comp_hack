<title>Devil Force</title>
 
<para>Devil Force is a feature that allows you to enhance the stats of your devil by feeding it items.  The items can either enhance one stat or several giving you variety.  When you accumulate a certain amount, you will gain a skill for your force stack that acts as a passive.  The amount of force stacks you can hold depends on the devil, and you can replace an old skill with a new one, or choose to reject it if it is not the skill you want.  The skills you can get vary from stat boosts, to damage boosts for attack types, up to resistance changes.</para>
