<title>Binary Data</title>
 
<para>Binary data is part of the client game data. It consists of the files in the <emphasis>BinaryData</emphasis> directory. This directory consists of two sub-directories: <emphasis>Client</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shield</emphasis>. Files in the <emphasis>Client</emphasis> directory are not encrypted; howeever, files in the <emphasis>Shield</emphasis> directory are. Encrypted files have the file extension <emphasis>sbin</emphasis> or <emphasis>stxt</emphasis>. Files that start with the prefix <emphasis>C</emphasis> are client related files. Files that start with the prefix <emphasis>S</emphasis> are server related files. Files that have no prefix are shared by both the client and server. This is a commonly accepted convention, not a rule. Most file include a format text file with the postfix <emphasis>Format</emphasis> that describe the structure of the file.</para>
