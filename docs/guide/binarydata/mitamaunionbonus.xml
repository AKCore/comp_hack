<title>Bonus Array</title>
<para>The bonus array is grouped into paris of values. The first value in a pair is the correct ID of the bonus. For example, a correct ID of 0 indicated a modification of the strength stat. The second value in the pair is the bonus. How the bonus is interpreted depends on the type of correct value being modified. In our example, it indicates a signed addition to the strength stat. For example, if a character had a strength stat of 5, if the value of this bonus was 3, their strength would now be 8; however, if the bonus was -3, their strength would now be 2. Normally a correct value will not reach zero and any zero or negative result would be changed to 1. The array consists of 3 pairs indicating the minimum, normal, and maximum value of the bonus.
